# phpMusicLibrary

phpMusicLibrary is a project to create a simple online music database. The idea is that artists, albums, track names, etc can be stored and viewed online in a simple, easy to read and mobile-friendly format.

### Prerequisites

PHP 5.3 or later
MySQL 4.1.3 or later

### Installing

Coming soon! I need to write the application first!
